### Run & expose php-apache server
To demonstrate Horizontal Pod Autoscaler we will use a custom docker image based on the php-apache image. The Dockerfile has the following content:
```
FROM php:5-apache
ADD index.php /var/www/html/index.php
RUN chmod a+rx index.php
```
It defines an index.php page which performs some CPU intensive computations:
```
<?php
  $x = 0.0001;
  for ($i = 0; $i <= 1000000; $i++) {
    $x += sqrt($x);
  }
  echo "OK!";
?>
```

First, we will start a deployment running the image and expose it as a service:
```
kubectl run php-apache --image=k8s.gcr.io/hpa-example --requests=cpu=200m --expose --port=80
service/php-apache created
deployment.apps/php-apache created
```

### Create Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
Now that the server is running, we will create the autoscaler using kubectl autoscale. The following command will create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler that maintains between 1 and 10 replicas of the Pods controlled by the php-apache deployment we created in the first step of these instructions. Roughly speaking, HPA will increase and decrease the number of replicas (via the deployment) to maintain an average CPU utilization across all Pods of 50% (since each pod requests 200 milli-cores by kubectl run, this means average CPU usage of 100 milli-cores). See here for more details on the algorithm.
```
kubectl autoscale deployment php-apache --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/php-apache autoscaled
```
We may check the current status of autoscaler by running:
```
kubectl get hpa
NAME         REFERENCE                     TARGET    MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
php-apache   Deployment/php-apache/scale   0% / 50%  1         10        1          18s
```
Please note that the current CPU consumption is 0% as we are not sending any requests to the server (the CURRENT column shows the average across all the pods controlled by the corresponding deployment).

### Increase load
Now, we will see how the autoscaler reacts to increased load. We will start a container, and send an infinite loop of queries to the php-apache service (please run it in a different terminal):
```
kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh
```
Hit enter for command prompt
```
while true; do wget -q -O- http://php-apache.default.svc.cluster.local; done
```
Within a minute or so, we should see the higher CPU load by executing:
```
kubectl get hpa
NAME         REFERENCE                     TARGET      CURRENT   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
php-apache   Deployment/php-apache/scale   305% / 50%  305%      1         10        1          3m
```
Here, CPU consumption has increased to 305% of the request. As a result, the deployment was resized to 7 replicas:
```
kubectl get deployment php-apache
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
php-apache   7         7         7            7           19m
```
Note: It may take a few minutes to stabilize the number of replicas. Since the amount of load is not controlled in any way it may happen that the final number of replicas will differ from this example.
### Stop load
We will finish our example by stopping the user load.

In the terminal where we created the container with busybox image, terminate the load generation by typing <Ctrl> + C.

Then we will verify the result state (after a minute or so):
```
kubectl get hpa
NAME         REFERENCE                     TARGET       MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
php-apache   Deployment/php-apache/scale   0% / 50%     1         10        1          11m
kubectl get deployment php-apache
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
php-apache   1         1         1            1           27m
```
Here CPU utilization dropped to 0, and so HPA autoscaled the number of replicas back down to 1.
